# Introduction to Physics

## Concept Overview
Physics is the natural science that studies matter, its fundamental constituents, its motion and behavior through space and time, and the related entities of energy and force.

## Key Principles
*   **Classical Mechanics**: Motion of macroscopic objects (Newton's Laws).
*   **Thermodynamics**: Heat, work, temperature, and statistical mechanics.
*   **Electromagnetism**: Study of electricity, magnetism, and light.
*   **Quantum Mechanics**: Behavior of matter and light on the atomic and subatomic scale.

## Real-world Application
**Engineering**: From designing bridges (statics) to building engines (thermodynamics) and electronics (electromagnetism).

## Quick Quiz
1.  **What is Newton's Second Law?**
    *   F = ma
2.  **What is the speed of light?**
    *   Approx 3 x 10^8 m/s
3.  **Unit of Energy?**
    *   Joule (J)

# Core Concepts: Forces & Motion

## Concept Overview
An in-depth look at how forces interact with matter to produce motion.

## Key Principles
*   **Inertia**: Resistance to change in motion.
*   **Momentum**: Product of mass and velocity.
*   **Friction**: Resisting force between surfaces.

## Real-world Application
**Automotive Safety**: Crumple zones maximize the time of impact to reduce force (Impulse).
